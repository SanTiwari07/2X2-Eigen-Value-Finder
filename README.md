# Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculator for 2x2 Matrices
This C++ program calculates the determinant, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix. Users can input the matrix elements, and the program performs the following tasks:

**Matrix Input and Display**: Displays the 2x2 matrix entered by the user.

**Determinant Calculation**: Computes the determinant of the matrix.

**Eigenvalues Calculation**: Determines the eigenvalues using the characteristic equation of the matrix.

**Eigenvectors Calculation**: Calculates and displays the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues.

The program uses basic C++ constructs and math functions (cmath for square root calculations). It's a great starting point for understanding the fundamentals of linear algebra and how to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors programmatically.
